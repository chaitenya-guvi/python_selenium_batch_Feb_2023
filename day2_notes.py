Rules \Guidelines for variable names  :

Conventions  : 

Naming Conventions

Most variables should be snake_case (underscores between words)
Variables that start and end with two underscores (called "dunder" for double underscore)
    are supposed to be private or left alone
Most variables should be also be lowercase, with some exceptions:
UpperCamelCase usually refers to a class 
Identifiers cannot be a keyword.
Identifiers are case-sensitive.
It can have a sequence of letters and digits. 
However, it must begin with a letter or _. 
The first letter of an identifier cannot be a digit.
It's a convention to start an identifier with a letter rather _.

Whitespaces are not allowed.
We cannot use special symbols like !, @, #, $, and so on.
CAPITAL_SNAKE_CASE usually refers to constants (e.g. PI = 3.14)
